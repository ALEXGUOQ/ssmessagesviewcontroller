# SSMessagesViewController

Simple message UI like Messages.app. I started writing this to create an in-app SMS feature for a client. Since Apple has made in-app SMS part of UI, I removed this from [SSToolkit](http://sstoolk.it).

## Running the Demo

You'll need to get SSToolkit first:

    $ git submodule init --update

Then you can just open Xcode and build away. Enjoy.
